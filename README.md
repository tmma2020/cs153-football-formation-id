# CS153 Football Formation Detection

This repository is for the class CS153 at Harvey Mudd, a computer vision class. The goal of this project is to detect formations in DIII football film, hopefully reducing the amount of time it takes to manually do so. The data for this project is from Pomona Pitzer's football program, so it is not publicly available. The sample data is used to demonstrate functionality.
